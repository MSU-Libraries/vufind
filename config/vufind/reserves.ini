; Any facet fields named in the translated_facets[] list below will have their values
; run through the translation code; values from unlisted facet fields will be
; displayed as-is without translation.
;
; For translated facets, be sure that all of the necessary strings are included in the
; language files found in the languages directory.
;
; You may add a colon and the name of a text domain after the field name to specify
; translations in a specific text domain (subdirectory of the languages folder).
;
; If you add a second colon, you may add a  translation string containing the
; placeholders %%raw%% and %%translated%%. You can enter the translation string
; directly (if the formatting is uniform for all languages), or you can use a key
; pointing to values found in the language files (if you need different formatting
; for different languages). This can be useful if the facet is related to a
; classification and you would like to show the raw value together with the
; translation (see the Dewey example below for a possible application).
;
; Commenting out all translated_facets[] lines below will disable facet translation.
